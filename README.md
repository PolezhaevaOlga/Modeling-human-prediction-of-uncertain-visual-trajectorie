# Modeling-human-prediction-of-uncertain-visual-trajectorie


This repository contains behavior data and models how humans extrapolate trajectories of moving objects under
uncertainty, focusing on Random Walk (RDW) and Independent Identically Distributed
(IID) paths. Across the experiment, participants performed trajectory prediction tasks,
and their responses were modeled using a normative baseline, a Sampling-Based
Probabilistic Model (SBPM), and a Dual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
network. The SBPM accounted for sensory noise and temporal perception, suggesting a
unified strategy across path types. The Dual LSTM model captured both binary responses
and reaction times. Both models revealed a recency bias, consistent with perceptual
decision-making theories.
